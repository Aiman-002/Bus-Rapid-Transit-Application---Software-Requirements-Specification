# Bus-Rapid-Transit-Application---Software-Requirements-Specification
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Application. The BRT Application aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for commuters and transportation authorities to facilitate and improve the BRT system.
The document defines the scope of the project, identifies the target users, and presents a detailed analysis of the system's requirements. It covers various aspects such as user interfaces, system functionalities, performance, security, and integration with external systems. Additionally, the SRS describes the use cases, system constraints, and the overall architecture of the BRT Application.

This SRS document serves as a reference for developers, designers, project stakeholders, and anyone involved in the development and implementation of the BRT Application. It ensures a clear understanding of the project's objectives, functionalities, and constraints, guiding the software development process and facilitating effective communication among project team members.

By documenting the software requirements in detail, this SRS aims to provide a solid foundation for the successful development, testing, and deployment of the Bus Rapid Transit Application.
